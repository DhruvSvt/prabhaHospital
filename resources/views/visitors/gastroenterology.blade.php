                <p>Heartburn is actually a symptom of GERD (gastro esophageal reflux disease), and is caused by acid refluxing back into the esophagus. Risk factors include those that increase the production of acid in the stomach, as well as structural problems that allow acid reflux into the esophagus.</p>

                <h6 class="text-center">Ulcers</h6>
                <p>The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the tummy (abdomen). But stomach ulcers aren't always painful and some people may experience other symptoms, such as indigestion, heartburn and acid reflux and feeling sick</p>

                <h6 class="text-center">Pancreatitis</h6>
                <p>Pancreatitis is the redness and swelling (inflammation) of the pancreas. It may be sudden (acute) or ongoing (chronic). The most common causes are alcohol abuse and lumps of solid material (gallstones) in the gallbladder. The goal for treatment is to rest the pancreas and let it heal</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 mt-5 mb-5">
                <h6 class="text-center">Hepatitis</h6>
                <p>Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. Hepatitis can be an acute (short-term) infection or a chronic (long-term) infection.</p>

                <h6 class="text-center">Colitis</h6>
                <p>Colitis can be caused by infections, loss of blood supply, or chronic diseases. Allergic reactions can also cause colitis. Chronic causes of colitis include inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</p>

                <h6 class="text-center">Cirrhosis</h6>
                <p>Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. Each time your liver is injured -whether by disease, excessive alcohol consumption or another cause -it tries to repair itself</p>

            <div class="col-lg-4 mt-5 mb-5">
                <h6 class="text-center">Alcoholic Liver Disease</h6>
                <p>Generally, symptoms of alcoholic liver disease include abdominal pain and tenderness, dry mouth and increased thirst, fatigue, jaundice (which is yellowing of the skin), loss of appetite, and nausea. Your skin may look abnormally dark or light. Your feet or hands may look red</p>

                <h6 class="text-center">Fatty Liver</h6>
                <p>When the liver does not process and break down fats as it normally should, too much fat will accumulate. People tend to develop fatty liver if they have certain other conditions, such as obesity, diabetes or high triglycerides. Alcohol abuse, rapid weight loss and malnutrition may also lead to fatty liver.</p>
